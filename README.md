# CitizenPremium

Tweak that enable [Citizen](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/citizen-local-safety-alerts/id1039889567) Premium features (including notifications).


## History

I found out a few weeks ago how to interact with Citizen app, I contacted them 5 times but they didn't get back to me.

So here's the free tweak

Tried on : iPhone 13, iOS 17.5.1, Citizen 0.1192.0

## How to install?

- You can use [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io) to inject this tweak into an IPA file.

- You can install it on a jailbroken device.

- You can inject it with Esign.

## To be fixed

- 'Ultra 911' tab crashing.
